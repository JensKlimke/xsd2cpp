# xsd2cpp
A very Q&D xsd parse.

This little piece of software has the purpose (for me) to parse OpenDRIVE xsd files and generate a c++ class structure with TinyXML2 as parser. If you like this tool (or don't like it) and wish to make it available for others to use it with in other contexts, you are very welcome to contribute.  

## Usage
see tests

## TODOs:
* Linkage of objects by defined keys (indexing)
* Work with other definition formats (e.g. xsd:: instead of xs::)
* Header-file header comments
