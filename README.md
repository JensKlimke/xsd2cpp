# xsd2cpp
A very Q&D xsd parser and C++ code generator.

This little piece of software has the purpose (for me) to parse OpenDRIVE xsd files and generate a c++ class structure with TinyXML2 as parser. If you like this tool (or don't like it) and wish to make it available for others to use it with in other contexts, you are very welcome to contribute. Just contact me.
